# Head-Count-and-Seat-Availability-System-for-University-Library
This project is a Logisim-based digital system designed to monitor library occupancy in real time by tracking the number of people entering and exiting a specific floor. It also calculates and displays the number of available seats using a sensor-driven counter system, arithmetic logic, and seven-segment display.
